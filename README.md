# Bone_farcture_detection
 I have created an automated approach to detect bone fractures using machine learning  and deep learning techniques. Since X-ray images are prone to noise, our system takes several preprocessing  steps to enhance image clarity and remove unwanted features. To address the challenges of  bone fracture diagnosis, our system uses a deep learning model based on Deep  Convolutional Neural Networks and machine learning. Finally based on the connected  component, our system detects fracture and draws bounding box around the fracture. Our  system offers several advantages over traditional manual examination methods. By  automating the fracture detection process, we reduce the reliance on human expertise,  minimizing the risk of errors and enabling faster diagnosis. Moreover, the image  preprocessing steps ensure clearer X-ray images, further enhancing the system's ability to  detect fractures with improved accuracy.
